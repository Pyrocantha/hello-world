# hello-world
I went through the GitHub tutorial on using GitHub in this repository. This is my first public practice of GitHub :)
I am a web developer and designer who is beginning her final steps towards getting her degree. I have two guinea pigs,
a loving and supporting family, and a lovely boyfriend I adore and hope to make my fianc√©e one day. Things are looking up,
and I'm determined to put my nose to the grindstone to get where I want to go.
